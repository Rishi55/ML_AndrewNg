Dear Friends,

Greetings from IIT Bombay!

The month of March was one of surprises. Having completed half of the semester, all students were ready to dive deep into academics, indulge in grabbing the PORs they were eyeing and a lot of activity was expected. The sudden outbreak of the coronavirus in the country saw a turn of events. The institute had to be shut down mid of March and students were asked to go home to prevent the virus from spreading.

Firstly, I would like to take the opportunity to inform you that IIT Bombay has been ranked 1st in India and has moved significantly up from 53rd rank last year to 44th rank this year in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings by Subject 2020. This is a result of the utmost dedication of the faculty, staff and students and we hope to register better positions in the future with the excellent talent and enthusiasm that thrives in our Institute.
